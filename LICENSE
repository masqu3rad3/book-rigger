This EULA is a legal agreement between you (a single natural person or the entity you represent) and TikWorks for the Book Rigger software, including any updates, example files, and documentation (the “Software”). By installing or using the Software, you agree to be bound by this EULA.

1. Ownership and roles

1.1. Copyright. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual-property laws. All copyrights and moral rights in the Software are owned by Arda Kutlu (the “Author”).
1.2. Exclusive distribution. The Author has granted TikWorks (Derya Engin Kutlu) an exclusive, worldwide right to sell, distribute, and license the Software to end users. Under that exclusive right, TikWorks is the sole licensor of end-user licenses for the Software.
1.3. No transfer of ownership. This EULA grants a license only; it does not transfer any ownership rights.

2. License grant

2.1. Grant. Subject to your compliance with this EULA and payment of applicable fees, TikWorks grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Software by one natural person per paid license key. A separate license is required for each additional user.
2.2. Commercial outputs. You may create and distribute your own outputs (e.g., renders, animations, scenes) created with the Software.
2.3. Seat & device. A license is tied to a single user (seat). You may install on multiple machines used exclusively by that same user. Concurrent use by more than one person requires additional licenses.
2.4. Studios & labs. For multi-seat, floating, classroom, or site licensing, contact TikWorks for a separate agreement.

3. Activation and connectivity

3.1. The Software may verify your license with TikWorks or its billing/licensing provider (e.g., Gumroad) using your product ID and license key.
3.2. The Software may implement limited offline grace periods; once the grace period ends, re-verification is required.
3.3. You agree not to circumvent, remove, or disable licensing or activation mechanisms.

(d) remove or alter copyright, attribution, or branding notices.

5. Updates & support

TikWorks may provide updates, bug fixes, or improvements at its discretion. Support terms and eligibility are described on the product page and may change over time.

6. Third-party services & components

6.1. Payments, license issuance, and/or license verification may be handled by third parties (e.g., Gumroad). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.
6.2. The Software may include or interoperate with third-party components under their own licenses. Those licenses will govern that third-party code.

7. Term and termination

This EULA is effective upon your first installation/use and continues until terminated. It terminates automatically if you materially breach it (including sharing keys or bypassing licensing). Upon termination, you must stop using the Software and destroy your copies. Sections 1, 4, 7–12 survive termination.

8. Disclaimer of warranties

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND AS AVAILABLE, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIKWORKS AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
